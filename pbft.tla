\* This TLA+ specification describes the normal case operation of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol.
\* See https://www.pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf for a full description of the protocol.

\* This specification can be checked with TLC and Apalache (https://apalache.informal.systems/). Note that typechecking with Apalache requires the --features=no-rows flag.

EXTENDS Integers, FiniteSets, TLC

\* This iteration of the specification is significantly simplified from the original paper.
\* We make the following simplifying assumptions:
\* - Always 4 nodes
\* - no view changes, 1 fixed primary (node R1) 
\* - no byzantine behavior
\* - no liveness properties
\* - dummy requests
\* - one client with concurrent requests
\* - no garbage collection/checkpointing (Sec. 4.3)

\* Set of replicas
\* Castro & Liskov 4 "We denote the set of replicas by R and identify each replica using an integer in {0,..|R|-1}."
\* Representing replicas as constants instead of integers allows us to use symmetry sets when checking safety properties with TLC
\* CONSTANT R0, R1, R2, R3
\* R == {R0, R1, R2, R3}

\* Switch replicas to strings for easy Apalache compatibility
R == {"R0", "R1", "R2", "R3"}

N == Cardinality(R)
F == (N - 1) \div 3

\* Castro & Liskov 4 "For simplicity, we assume N=3F+1 where F is the maximum number of replicas that may be faulty."
ASSUME N = 3*F + 1

\* A fixed primary
PRIMARY == "R0"
\* Don't include the primary in the symmetry set
Symmetry == Permutations(R \ {PRIMARY})

\* Byzantine replicas
ByzR == {"R2"}
ASSUME ByzR \subseteq R

\* Set of all request timestamps
\* We use just natural numbers as there's a single client
Tstamps == 1..2

\* Bounding sequence numbers to the total number of requests
SeqNums == Tstamps

\* Our dummy app will return the request sequence number
Results == SeqNums

Views == {0}

\* Digest takes a client request and returns a unique identifier
\* Since we are assuming timestamps are unique, we can use them as the digest
\* @type: [ t : Int ] => Int;
Digest(m) == m.t

Digests == Tstamps

\* Normal case operation of PBFT

\* Castro & Liskov 4.1 "A client requests the execution of state machine operation o by sending a (REQUEST,o,t,c) message to the primary. Timestamp t is used to ensure exactly once semantics for the execution of client requests. Timestamps for c’s requests are totally ordered such that later requests have higher timestamps than earlier ones; for example, the timestamp could be the value of the client’s local clock when the request is issued. Each message sent by the replicas to the client includes the current view number, allowing the client to track the view and hence the current primary. A client sends a request to what it believes is the current primary using a point-to-point message. The primary atomically multicasts the request to all the backups using the protocol described in the next section."

\* We begin with all client requests already in the set of messages
\* We omit the operation o and client c for simplicity
