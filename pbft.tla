\* This TLA+ specification describes the normal case operation of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol.
\* See https://www.pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf for a full description of the protocol.
\* This specification can be checked with TLC and Apalache (https://apalache.informal.systems/). Note that typechecking with Apalache requires the --features=no-rows flag.
\* This iteration of the specification is significantly simplified from the original paper.
\* We make the following simplifying assumptions:
\* - no view changes, 1 fixed primary (node R1) 
\* - no byzantine primaries
\* - no liveness properties
\* - dummy requests
\* - one client with concurrent requests
\* - no garbage collection/checkpointing (Sec. 4.3)

EXTENDS Integers, FiniteSets, TLC

\* Set of replicas
\* Castro & Liskov 4 "We denote the set of replicas by R and identify each replica using an integer in {0,..|R|-1}."
CONSTANT 
\* @type: Set(Int);
    R

N == Cardinality(R)
F == (N - 1) \div 3

\* Castro & Liskov 4 "For simplicity, we assume N=3F+1 where F is the maximum number of replicas that may be faulty."
ASSUME N = 3*F + 1

\* Don't include the primary in the symmetry set

ASSUME ByzR \subseteq R

\* Set of request timestamps
\* We use just natural numbers as there's a single client
Tstamps == Nat

\* Set of sequence numbers
\* Bounding sequence numbers to the total number of requests
SeqNums == Tstamps

\* Sequence numbers to checkpoint at. An empty set means checkpointing is disabled
CONSTANT

ASSUME Checkpoints \subseteq SeqNums

\* Normal case operation of PBFT

\* Castro & Liskov 4.1 "A client requests the execution of state machine operation o by sending a (REQUEST,o,t,c) message to the primary. Timestamp t is used to ensure exactly once semantics for the execution of client requests. Timestamps for c’s requests are totally ordered such that later requests have higher timestamps than earlier ones; for example, the timestamp could be the value of the client’s local clock when the request is issued. Each message sent by the replicas to the client includes the current view number, allowing the client to track the view and hence the current primary. A client sends a request to what it believes is the current primary using a point-to-point message. The primary atomically multicasts the request to all the backups using the protocol described in the next section."

\* We begin with all client requests already in the set of messages
\* We omit the operation o and client c for simplicity

The message has the form ((PRE-PREPARE,v,n,d),m), where v indicates the view in which the message is being sent, m is the client's request message, and d is m's digest."
\* Note that we have extended the preprepare message to include the primary's identity. This is not described in the paper as sender identity is implicit in the message signature, however, since we do not model signatures we must represent the sender explicitly.
